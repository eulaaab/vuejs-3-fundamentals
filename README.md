# Eula Bengco Learning Vue - VueJS 3 Fundamentals Master Class


This repository is me learning Vue from the [Vue.js 3 Fundamentals](https://vueschool.io/courses/vuejs-3-fundamentals) course. It was avaiable for Free during the weekend of March 26-28, 2021

I learned the fundamental concepts of Vue.js 3 and create a solid foundation for your Vue journey.

### The Vue.js 3 Fundamentals course covered:
- Introduction to two-way data binding
- Template syntax and expressions
- Vue directives, loops and conditional rendering
- Vue Devtools
- Handling user Inputs
- Handling Events
- Vue.js Methods and Computed Properties (perform tranformations or calculations on our data e.g. computed property that calculates length of text on an input, powerful tool for encapsulating data transformation and manipulation that stays sync in the data they reference)
- Attribute Bindings and dynamic classes

The live demo is a shopping list app where you can add items in the items array, use vue directives to dynamically render elements in the dom, and learned the two-way binding power of vue.
